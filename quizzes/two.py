# we are going to read the scores.dat file and grab all the teams within
# we want to open scores.dat file
# we want to regex and grab all the teams and then store them in a list


# The file football.dat contains the results from the English Premier League for 2001/2. 
# \The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against 
# each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals 
# scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest 
# difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.
